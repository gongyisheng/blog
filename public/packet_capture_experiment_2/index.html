Goal
Get a better understanding of how send/receive buffer size may affect the network rtt and throughput. Usually send/receive buffer size is managed by kernal and application should not hardcode these values. However, real world cases are more rare and complicated. Inapporiate buffer size may be the root case of some network issues. Rare but possible.

<h3 id="result-and-analysis">Result and Analysis</h3>
<p>To simplify, here I’ll only focus on client side packet capture result. For those who are interested in packet capture result on both sides, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/gongyisheng/playground/tree/main/network/experiment">github repo</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
<p><img src="./images/result.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Note: rtt and throughput is estimated from graph. dup ack, retransmission, out-of-order, zero window, window full is from wireshark expert info.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Relation between BDP and buffer size</p>
<p>BDP: Bandwidth Delay Product, measured by bandwidth*ttl. It’s the maximum size of packets in flight for a network.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about the buffer size. Considering that Linux assumes that half of the send/receive TCP buffers are used for internal structures. Thus, only half of the buffer size is used to store segments, buffer size should be at least 2 BDP to leave enough space for bytes in flight. But that may still be not enoght.</p>
<p><img src="./images/bdp-1.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>If there’s packet lost, it has to take 2 rtt to transmit the packet in total. Thus, to fully utilize the available bandwidth, the TCP send and receive buffers must be large enough to prevent such situation (eg, 4 BDP, 8 BDP)</p>
<p><img src="./images/bdp-2.png" alt="img"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Window size</p>
<p>The receiver must constantly communicate with the sender to indicate how much free buffer space is available in the TCP receive buffer. This information is carried in a TCP header field called window size.</p>
<p>Window size = window * 2 ^ scaling factor accoring to RFC 1323.</p>
<p><img src="./images/window-size-1.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>When the TCP buffer is full, a window size of zero is advertised to inform the other end that it cannot receive any more data. When a client sends a TCP window of zero, the server will pause its data transmission, and waits for the client to recover. Once the client is recovered, it digests data, and inform the server to resume the transmission again by setting again the TCP window.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>After limiting send buffer size or receive buffer size, rtt becomes quite sensitive to packet loss and corruption, both of which result in a big jump in rtt.</li>
<li>Reorder and duplicate may not affect rtt a lot: due to a small buffer size, the reorder packets are immediately maked as lost and retransmission packet will be sent. Deplicated packets will be thrown away quickly.</li>
<li>Bandwidth limit only afftect rtt when send buffer size is small, causing send buffer full, which makes me recall the post I wrote before: <a href="https://blog.yellowday.day/redis_oom_due_to_big_keys/">Redis OOM due to big keys</a></li>
<li>Client/Server high cpu affects rtt in a different pattern. RTT is good at the beginning but soon increases a lot after the driver queue becomes full of data and cpu is too busy to write them in / read them out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion-Limit send buffer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To my surprise, limiting send buffer does not take effect and the throughput is still high as 50mbps, I’m still trying the figure out the reason. There’s some unconfirmed speculations around config overwrite and wmem_queued. I’ll get back this question in another post.</li>
<li>Increase packet delay (rtt) can almost kill the throughput, maybe it hits the buffer limit somehow?</li>
<li>Packet loss and corrupt can reduce the throughput by 60%, it’s much larger than what we see when there’s no limit on send buffer. It looks also hit the buffer limit and ack delay cause the throughput drop, but need more evidence.</li>
<li>Same as when there’s no buffer limit, duplicated packet does not have impact on throughput.</li>
<li>Bandwidth limit also almost kill the throughput. But there’s an interesting finding: I limit bandwidth to 1 mbps but the actual bandwidth is only 625 kbps. It’s also something needs further investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion-Limit receive buffer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit receive buffer can greatly affect the throughput. The buffer size is too small, it cannot fill BDP any more. Can’t help but wait a round trip’s time to notify the server to update window and send next packets.</li>
<li>Increase packet delay (rtt) almost reduce throughput to zero. A very high percentage of window full is reported.</li>
<li>Packet loss and corrupt cuts throughput by 30%, which is expected. Retransmission packets takes 2 rtt and it’ll reduce the overall throughput.</li>
<li>Packet duplicate does not reduce throughput. The duplicated packets are dropped.</li>
<li>Bandwidth limit continue to take effect on throughput when there’s receive buffer limit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion-Server/Client high CPU usage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Throughput is high at first, but quickly dropped after several seconds (about 10 to 20)</li>
<li>High CPU usage cases has a higher rate of dup ACKs, but not many TCP zero window / TCP window full. There may be problem around sending / receiving packets when CPU usage is high. A high percentage of dup ACKs are found, which means potential packet lost.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion-Overall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Throughput becomes quite sensitive to almost every factor (lost, corrupt, reorder, and rtt increase) when the buffer size is small. If the network condition is good, that’s fine. But it’ll be a mess when the network condition is bad.</li>

<img src="./images/ts-exp-client-cpu-100.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most things are expected, like small buffer size + packet loss / corrupt / reorder causes plateau in the graph. Bandwidth limit and packet delay increases rtt results in step-shaped graph.</li>
<li>The packet size of limiting receive buffer size is smaller than those of limiting send buffer size, which makes the time/sequence graph of rmem=4096 cases are more dense.</li>
<li>In high cpu usage cases there’s turning point in the graph. The throughput before/after turning point is different but no plateau is found.</li>

<img src="./images/ws-exp-client-cpu-100.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window size is normal when we limit send buffer size. (not quite related with send buffer)</li>
<li>Window size is only 1000-2000 when we limit receive buffer size, which limits the ability server to send more packets.</li>
<li>In high cpu usage cases, the window size is normal in most of the cases but sometimes it scales up a lot. It’s caused by packet lost and client keeps sending dup ACKs, but the server does not react to that and still sends the next packets. It’s likely to be caused by a long drive queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Details</p>
<p><strong>send buffer limit</strong></p>
<p>Everything looks good until there’s packet lost, retransmission takes too much time.</p>
<p><img src="./images/send-buffer-limit.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><strong>receive buffer limit</strong></p>
<p>A mess. TCP window is full almost every time. Window and packet size is very small.</p>
<p><img src="./images/receive-buffer-limit.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><strong>High CPU usage</strong></p>
<p>Everything looks good until there’s a packet lost. Too many Dup ACKs are sent out until retransmission happens.</p>
<p><img src="./images/skb.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>One of the guesses is the driver queue causes packet lost. Driver queue (aka ring buffer) is typically implemented as a first-in, first-out (FIFO) ring buffer, which holds descriptors which point to other data structures called socket kernel buffers (<a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb.html">SKBs</a>) which hold the packet data and are used throughout the kernel. Packet lost may happen when driver queue is full because of high cpu, either during sending or receiving packets.</p>
